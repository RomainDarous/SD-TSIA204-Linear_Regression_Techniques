# SD-TSIA204 : Linear Regression Techniques
In the Linear Regression lab for TELECOM Paris SD-TSIA204, the following algorithms are implemented:

- Ordinary Least Square (OLS),
- Lasso Regression,
- Ridge regression,
- Elastic Net regession.

Then, cross-validation is performed to chose penalty paremeters for both Ridge and Lasso.

Finally, Bootstrap resampling is implemented, as well as PCA to perform singular value decomposition and extract features that explain most of the variance of the data.
